1/ How you can survive the AI revolution in Data Management: a ðŸ§µ

At VectorLink.ai (https://vectorlink.ai) we are performing experiments with LLM automation for data management processes. We've had big success with improving record matching outcomes.

2/ The use of vector embeddings and the language capabilities of LLMs have opened up a huge range of new potential applications, many of which would have been complete science fiction only 10 years ago.

3/ What are these changes and how can businesses be prepared for the disruption? Automation works if you can reduce human time spent on production by employing machinery which is cheaper than that human time, then you have automation.

4/ In our experiments (e.g. https://vectorlink.ai/blog/llm-classifier-bootstrapping/ ) we have found that generative AI can be very effective at generating training sets by annotation, much in the way that a human would do.

5/ In this experiment I can't do better than the AI unless I used auxiliary information from the internet (something which will be possible to add to the AI's arsenal!). The machine is ready to replace me in this thankless task (thank goodness!).

6/ And the price? It was approximately $2 per hour. The price point has been falling very quickly. Just over the last year we saw the price of embeddings fall by a factor of 10 (literally!).

7/ The change will not be everywhere, all at once. A recent MIT study which shows that automation can be expensive https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/rethinking-ais-impact-mit-csail-study-reveals-economic-limits-job-automation

8/ However if price points are falling as fast as they appear to be, then what is too expensive today may be extremely cheap next year. \$50 and hour could quickly fall to $5.

9/ It seems to me that the optimists are likely to be more right and the good money is on betting on automation now rather than later when your competitor already has the process in place.

10/ How important is it to beat your competitor to automation?

Nobel prize winner Daron Acemoglu showed that firms which adopt robots win https://news.mit.edu/2020/robots-help-firms-workers-struggle-0505 and those that don't lose.

11/ Now that robots can do cognitive labour the same process will play out in all sorts of data management tasks. Those that can identify cognitive automation potential and are fastest at adopting them will win and grow, and those who do not will be made quickly non-viable.

12/ Were will it happen first? Discoverability engineering

- Tagging and taxonomy
- Entity Resolution
- Data transformation and indexing

13/ Discoverability engineering will be done by AIs which employ extremely easy to use natural language interfaces. The identification of which entities (people, corporations, products) are associated with data will be identified and curated by an AI.

14/ Not only is record matching possible, but general classification of all records to the appropriate entity. The process of data engineering which produces data products will still require some architecture by humans, filling it will not.

15/ This will replace a whole swath of reporting tools and dashboards which will go the way of the dodo as insights appear via conversation. The AI will give us the report which is needed now, rather than the one which seemed important 6 months ago.

16/ The role of companies and the relationship to the specifics are more clear. The winners tomorrow need to be automating cognitive labour now.
